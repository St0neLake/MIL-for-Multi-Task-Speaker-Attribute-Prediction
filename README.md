# MIL for Multi Task Speaker Attribute Prediction
Traditionally, models predict one speaker attribute at a time (e.g., gender or political ideology). However, many speaker attributes are related, and by leveraging multi-task learning, we can predict multiple attributes simultaneously. For example, predicting age and gender together may improve accuracy since these attributes often correlate in language usage patterns. In this project, you will explore different multi-task learning frameworks, such as hard parameter sharing (where all tasks share the same model layers except for the output layer) or soft parameter sharing (where each task has its own model, but some layers are shared). By sharing representations across tasks, the model could learn better general features that improve performance on all tasks.
